**A few requesting tips to make requesting even better**
<br>

Create a requesting applet on your iPhone:

• On your phone's Safari app, navigate to the <a href="https://request.willystation.com">WillyStation Request Site</a>
• Click the "Share" button on the bottom of the browser:

• Search Movie/Show and simply click "Request" button.
<br>
<br>
*Movies will be available to stream within 5-30 minutes. If a movie has not been added to Plex within an hour after request, please email or text.*
<br>

<br>**Note for TV Series:**

Movies are auto-requested by default.

TV series are not.

For long-form tv series, please only request one or two seasons at a time and I will review and approve request.

*If a TV request has not been approved within 24 hours, please email or text.*
