*Once you have created a new account and accepted the libray invitation, it is now time to set up your account.*
<br>
<br>
<br>
On your favorite stream device, find and install the Plex app.
<br>
<br>

>**Note for people wanting to stream from Mac:**
<br>
<br>
Do not use the browser-based Plex app. 
<br>
<br>
Please download the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=macos#plex-app">Plex Desktop App for MAC OS</a>.
<br>

<br>
Once installed, sign in with your Plex account.
<br>
<br>


>**Optional: Remove all of Plex's built-in libraries (i.e Discover, Live TV, Movies & Shows)<br><br> Keep only the ones that you were invited to by me, which are as follows:**
<br>
<br>
Anime
<br>
Anime (Film)
<br>
Movies
<br>Movies (4K) &dagger;</br>
TV
<br>TV (4K) &dagger;</br>
Music (Videos)
<br>
Music
<br>The Adult Section &dagger;</br>
<br>&dagger; By Request Only</br>

<br>
**Important Final Step:** 

After [optionally] setting up your libraries, head to:
<br>
<br>
> Settings > Quality
<br>
<br>
> Disable any setting like "Use Recommended Settings"
<br>
<br>
Change Remote and Local/Home Streaming Quality settings to "Maximum" or "Original" (platform dependent)
<br>
>> note: this setting will need to be changed *once* upon login for any new device.

<br>
After signing in to the Plex App, you can start streaming Movies and TV Shows!
<br>
<br>
If you plan to request Movies or TV Shows, head <a href="Request%20Movies%20%26%20Shows/Requesting%20Movies%20%26%20Shows/" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">here</a>.
